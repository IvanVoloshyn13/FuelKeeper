# FuelKeeper

FuelKeeper is an application that allows you to record data about your car refuelings. By filling in the respective fields, we create a record of fueling that issaved in a local database. We can view a list of all 
the refuelings, edit them or delete. On the main screen, we can see all statistics, such as average fuel consumption, driving cost,data from the last refueling,and more.
